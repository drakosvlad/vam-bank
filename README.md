## Architecture

The transaction processing, interest calculation and POS Terminal integrations are performed in separate threads. The transaction queue is processed sequentially, in one thread, so that the transactions can't conflict with each other. 

For data persistence we are using Proxy-Model architecture â€“ read requests are handled by data models, while write requests are forwarded to the database service.

For calculating different fees for the transactions between the accounts of different types, we are using the templates specified with Policy classes that handle the fees calculation.
